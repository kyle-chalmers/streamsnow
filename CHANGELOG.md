# Changelog

All notable changes to StreamSnow are recorded here. This project follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) once it reaches its first release.

## [Unreleased]

Initial implementation.

### CLI (`streamsnow`)
- `configure` / `init` / `new` — set up the Snowflake environment and scaffold a
  governed monorepo + apps (container or warehouse runtime).
- `doctor` — machine + config prerequisite checks.
- `validate-app` — deterministic PASS/FAIL gate; `check schema-refs|security|caching|bind-predicates`.
- `preview` — run an app locally against live Snowflake.
- `deploy-setup` / `deploy-sql` / `stage-path` / `config-get` — deploy SQL + helpers
  for stage-copy and git-repository sources.
- `update` — re-render governance files from the current config (dry-run by default).

### Claude Code plugin
- 14 skills (onboard, refine-requirements, new-app, add-page, preview-app,
  validate-app, ship-app, start-app, review-app, deep-dive-data, apply-review,
  auto-review-app, sql-review, migrate-app) + 4 shared recipes.
- SessionStart hook, guarded to StreamSnow repos.

### Governance & safety
- Typed, validated `streamsnow.config.yaml` with an injection-safe rendering gate.
- Config-driven schema allow/deny, app-security, caching-TTL, and bind-predicate checks.
- Pre-publish privacy/export gate; generated repos ship pre-commit + CI guardrails.

### Packaging
- PyPI Trusted-Publishing release workflow; wheel-smoke + 3.11/3.12 CI matrix.
